                    The thing I am most curious about is the nature of consciousness and how a 1.4kg blob of neurons,
                    tissues and blood ðŸ§  results in the experience of a chocolate lava cake tasting so good!

                    Beyond being an intellectual thought experiment, this problem underlies my core values and
                    philosophy in
                    life.

                    Everything we have experienced, are currently experiencing, and will ever experience occurs in our
                    conscious awareness. Our goals, pain, trauma, and joy all occur in awareness.
