                    The thing I am most curious about is the nature of consciousness, how on earth does a 1.4kg blob of
                    neurons,
                    tissues and blood (i.e: ðŸ§ ) create the profound experience of bliss I experience when eating
                    chocolate lava cake?

                    Beyond being an intellectual thought experiment, this problem underlies my core values and
                    philosophy in
                    life.

                    Everything we have experienced, are currently experiencing, and will ever experience occurs in our
                    conscious awareness. Our goals, pain, trauma, and joy all occur in awareness.

                    who
                    initially kindled my fascination in the nature of mind put it perfectly when he said:

                        "How we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experience

                    This has manifested for me an intense passion for meditation, mindfulness and yoga (of which Iâ€™m a
                    practising teacher)
                    <br/><br/>

                    Additionally, itâ€™s made me fascinated by epistemology (The theory of knowledge and how we learn).
                    Iâ€™m constantly pushing myself to learn new things (specifically things that get me out of my comfort
                    zone) and, in the process, paying attention to the subtle experiences that occur when learning
                    something new such that I can learn the next skill better or, more importantly, teach it to others.
